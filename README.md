# COVID-19 Forecasting Project

Two .csv files are needed for the confirmed cases and deaths related to COVID-19 (included in this repository). They were mounted on my Google Drive when I was running this in Google Colaboratory. If running locally, the two lines of code that read in the .csv files will need to be changed to the appropriate path. The code produces several plots and trains three different LSTM models. The project was built using Google Colaboratory. It is in .ipynb format, so should be able to also run locally on Jupyter, though it was not tested with that.
